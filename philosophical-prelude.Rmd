The fundamental nature of probability as used in applied statistical
inference was described succinctly by John Stuart Mill as part of his
larger program of characterizing inductive reasoning,^[Mill, John
Stuart.  1882.  *A System of Logic: Raciocinative and Inductive*.
Eighth edition. Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York. Part III,
Chapter 18.]

> We must remember that the probability of an event is not a quality
of the event itself, but a mere name for the degree of ground which
we, or some one else, have for expecting it. <br /> $\ldots$ Every event is
in itself certain, not probable; if we knew all, we should either know
positively that it will happen, or positively that it will not. But
its probability to us means the degree of expectation of its
occurrence, which we are warranted in entertaining by our present
evidence.

Mill is saying that our estimate of the probability of an event
fundamentally depends on how much we know.  For example, if you ask me
now to forecast the weather on a random day in Edinburgh next year,
I'll forecast 52% because it rains on average 191 days per year in
Edinburgh.^[World Weather and Climate (2018) [Edinburgh
rainfall](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainy-days,Edinburgh-uk,Scotland).]
If I know the day is in December, I'll make an estimate of 58%
conditioned on knowing that it rains on average 18 of 31 days in December.
Continuing to add information, if it's December 7 and I have
up-to-date radar, then my estimate of the chance of rain on December 8
or December 9 might be anything, depending on the current
meteorological conditions.^[The current forecast from
[weather.com](https://weather.com/weather/today/l/55.95,-3.19) as of
11:30 pm December 7, 2018 is a 60% chance of rain on December 8 and
a 10% chance of rain on December 9.]

Putting Mill's view in more modern terms, probability is a relative
measure of uncertainty conditioned on available information.  In other
words, probability involves statements about an agent's or collection
of agents' knowledge of the world, not about the world directly.^[In
philosophical terms, the nature of probability is *epistemic* (based
on knowledge) rather than *ontological* (based on metaphysics) or
*deontic* (based on belief).]  This allows us to believe the world is
deterministic, while still reasoning probabilistically based on
available evidence. Apparently, this was Pierre-Simon Laplace's
position, as he wrote,^[Pierre-Simon Laplace. 1814.  *A Philosophical
Essay on Probabilities*. English translation of the 6th edition,
Truscott, F.W. and Emory, F.L. 1951. Dover Publications.  page 4.]

> We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its
  past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain
  moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all
  positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this
  intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it
  would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest
  bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an
  intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the
  past would be present before its eyes.

It also provides us the wiggle room to take sides with Albert
Einstein, who wrote,^[Albert Einstein.  1926.  Personal letter to Max
Born. December 4.]

> The theory [quantum mechanics] says a lot, but does not really bring
  us any closer to the secret of the "old one." I, at any rate, am
  convinced that He does not throw dice.

Probability theory merely provides a mathematically and logically
consistent approach to quantifying uncertainty and performing
inductive inference.
