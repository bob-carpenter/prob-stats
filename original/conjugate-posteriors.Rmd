If we think The sum $\alpha + \beta$ is most naturally thought of as a
prior observation count plus two.  The reason for the plus two is that
one is subtracted in each of the exponents, $\alpha - 1$ and $\beta -
1$, and a total count of two is required to reach a uniform
distribution, corresponding to an observation count of zero.
