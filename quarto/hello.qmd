## Introduction

Our goal with this book is to teach you about probability theory,
statistics, and simulation-based inference.  Our approach is to go
step-by-step like an introduction to programming and use computer
simulation rather than analytic math to solve problems.

To make the book concrete, we will use `Stan`, a platform-neutral
probabilistic programming language (PPL).

* [Stan home page](https://mc-stan.org)

We will interface to `Stan` using Python with Stan's `cmdstanpy`
interface.  For installation and getting started instructions, as well
as complete doc and examples, see

```stan
data {
  int a;
  int b;
}
transformed data {
  int c = a + b;
  print(a, " + ", b, " = ", c);
}
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a really cool polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
