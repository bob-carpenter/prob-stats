# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods

## Monte Carlo Methods

*Monte Carlo methods*^[Monte Carlo methods are so-called because of
the Monte Carlo Casino (shown below), located in the Principality of
Monaco. <br /> &nbsp; <br /> ![](img/mc-casino.jpg) <span
style="float:right; font-size:60%; color:#999999;">&copy; Z.graber,

numerical solutions to definite integrals, usually in high
dimensions.^[The book could've been subtitled "A Monte Carlo
approach," but like putting "Bayesian" before "statistics", it's
needlessly obscure nomenclature.]  We have seen numerous examples in
earlier chapters.

When we can simulate a sample of independent draws $\theta =
\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(M)}$ according to the posterior
$p(\theta \mid y)$, we can use them to calculate parameter estimates,
event probabilities, and other expectations.  The convergence of such
estimates is governed by the central limit theorem and proceeds at an
expected error rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}).$^[The
reduction in error is all relative to the scale of the quantity being
sampled.]  This rate is manageable in most circumstances, but cannot
be used for high precision applications because the number of
iterations required for a given number of decimals of precision grows
exponentially.^[Each additional decimal digit requires the error to be
reduced by a factor of 10, and thus requires 100 times as much
computation, because $\frac{1}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{1}{10}$.]

## Markov chain Monte Carlo methods

For most statistical models we want to fit for applications, no
methods exist for taking independent draws from the posterior.  What
we can do in most cases is create a Markov chain $\theta =
\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(M)}$ of draws, the stationary
distribution of which is the posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ of
interest. We then use the elements of the chain $\theta$ to estimate
expectations and quantiles in the same way as the independent sample
from the posterior.  This is the basis of Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods.

As we saw in the chapter on finite Markov chains, the rate of
convergence varies depending on how much each draw $\theta^{(m + 1)}$
depends on the previous draw $\theta^{(m)}$.^[If the $\theta^{(m)}$
are independent, the central limit theorem governs the convergence.]

## Continuous-state Markov chains

The definitions we have already made for Markov chains apply to chains
with continuous values.  A random process $Y = Y_1, Y_2, \ldots,$ has
discrete time steps but may have discrete or continuous values or even
multivariate values, which may themselves be discrete, continuous, or
a mixture of the two.  Such a process is a *Markov chain* if for all
$t$, and all states $y_1, \ldots, y_{t+1}$,

$$
p_{Y_{t+1} \mid Y_t}(y_{t+1} \mid y_t)
\ = \
p_{Y_{t+1} \mid Y_t, Y_{t-1}, \ldots, Y_1}(y_{t+1} \mid y_t, y_{t-1}, \ldots, y_1).
$$

We are also assuming that our Markov chains are *time homogeneous* in
that the conditional probability distribution of the next state is
always the same.  That means that for all $t'$, the conditional
distribution of the next element at $t$ is the same as that at $t'$,

$$
p_{Y_{t+1} \mid Y_t}
\ = \
p_{Y_{t' + 1} \mid Y_{t'}}.
$$

All of the Markov chains we will consider will have transitions that
are time homogeneous.

To simplify notation, we will write
$p_t$ for $p_{Y_{t+1} \mid Y_t}$


## Stationary distributions

Let's look at univariate continuous Markov chains first.  Such a chain
has real-valued states $Y_t \in \mathbb{R}$.  Let

$$
\tau(u, v) = p_{Y_{t+1} \mid Y_{t}}(v \mid u)
$$

be the conditional distribution of the next state $v$ if the current
state is $u$, where $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$.  We will call $\tau$ the
transition distribution of the chain.

A density function $\pi(u)$ for $u \in \mathbb{R}$ is the density
function of the *stationary distribution* for transition function
$\tau(u, v)$ if

$$
\pi(u)
\ = \
\int_{\mathbb{R}}
\, \pi(v) \times \tau(v, u)
\, \mathrm{d}v.
$$

In words, $\pi$ is a stationary density if its value at a point $u$ is
the average transition probability $\tau(v, u)$, where the average
is weighted by the stationary density of $v$.

In order to sample from the posterior of a model with posterior
density $p(\theta \mid y)$ with parameters $\theta$ conditioned on
observed data $y$, we will construct Markov chains for which

$$
\pi(\theta) = p(\theta \mid y).
$$

We can also think of continuous Markov chains in terms of volumes.  No
matter how the space is partitioned into disjoint volumes, the
probabilities of being in a volume and transitioning between volumes
defines a discrete Markov chain.^[The stationary probability of a
volume $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ is just $$\pi(U) = \int_U \pi(u)
\mathrm{d}u.$$ and the probability of transitioning to volume $V
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ conditioned on being at state $u \in
\mathbb{R}^N$ is given by $$\tau(u, V) = \int_V \pi(v) \tau(u, v)
\mathrm{d}v.$$]

## Reversibility

The notion of reversibility extends to continuous chains, where $\tau$
is said to be *reversible* with respect to $\pi$ if for all $u, v$,

$$
\pi(u) \times \tau(u, v) = \pi(v) \times \tau(v, u).
$$

If the transition function of a Markov chain is reversible with
respect to $\pi$, then $\pi$ is the stationary distribution for the
chain.  The other way around, not every transition function with a
stationary distribution is reversible.

## Periodic chains

Continuous chains may exhibit periodicity just like discrete chains.
The idea is that it revisits volumes in a predictable way.  For
example, consider a chain where the space has been divided into four
non-overlapping regions $A, B, C, D$, and where

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t+1} \in B \mid Y_t \in A] & = & 1
\\[4pt]
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t+1} \in C \mid Y_t \in B] & = & 1
\\[4pt]
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t+1} \in D \mid Y_t \in C] & = & 1
\\[4pt]
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t+1} \in A \mid Y_t \in D] & = & 1
\end{array}
$$

We can easily simulate such a chain by taking $A, B, C, D$ to be unit
boxes in each quadrant of the real plane, starting in the positive
(upper right) quadrant and moving clockwise.  The Markov chain may be
simulated as.

```
y[1] <- (uniform_rng(0, 1), uniform_rng(0, 1))
for (t in 2:T)
  if (y[t - 1] in A)
    y[t] = uniform_rng(B)
  else if (y[t - 1] in B)
    y[t] = uniform_rng(C)
  else if (y[t - 1] in C)
    y[t] = uniform_rng(D)
  else
    y[t] = uniform_rng(A)
```

Let's plot that for $T = 20$ steps.

```{r fig.cap = "Plot of 20 steps of a periodic continuous Markov chain.  Each value is drawn from a unit quadrant starting from the upper right (positive) quadrant and proceeding in a clockwise order."}
period_df <- data.frame(x = c(), y = c(), t = c())

t <- 1
set.seed(1234)
for (k in 1:5) {
  period_df <- rbind(period_df,
                     data.frame(x = runif(1, 0, 1), y = runif(1, 0, 1),
		                t = t),
                     data.frame(x = runif(1, 0, 1), y = runif(1, -1, 0),
		                t = t + 1),
                     data.frame(x = runif(1, -1, 0), y = runif(1, -1, 0),
		                t = t + 2),
                     data.frame(x = runif(1, -1, 0), y = runif(1, 0, 1),
		                t = t + 3))
  t <- t + 4
}

period_plot <-
  ggplot(period_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = t)) +
  geom_path(size = 0.2, arrow = arrow(angle = 10, length = unit(0.125, "inches"))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(-1.1, 1.1), breaks = c()) +
  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(-1.1, 1.1), breaks = c()) +
  xlab(expression(y[1])) +
  ylab(expression(y[2])) +
  annotate("text", label = "A", x = 0.9, y = 0.9) +
  annotate("text", label = "B", x = 0.9, y = -0.9) +
  annotate("text", label = "C", x = -0.9, y = -0.9) +
  annotate("text", label = "D", x = -0.9, y = 0.9) +
  ggtheme_tufte() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
period_plot
```

We say that a Markov chain $Y = Y_1, Y_2, \ldots$ is *periodic* if
there are volumes $A_1, \ldots, A_K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ such that
the chain moves deterministically from $A_1$ to $A_2$ to $A_3$ and
finally from $A_K$ back to $A_1$.  In symbols, a chain is defined to
be periodic if

$$
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t + 1} \in A_{k + 1} \mid Y_t \in A_k] = 1
\ \mbox{if} \ 1 \leq k < K
$$

and

$$
\mbox{Pr}[Y_{t + 1} \in A_1 \mid Y_t \in A_K] = 1.
$$

## Irreducibility

Roughly speaking, a Markov chain on a continuous space is
*irreducible* if every subset of nonzero volume has a positive
probability of eventually being visited from any other point in the
space.^[In general, a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ has hypervolume
$$\mbox{vol}(A)
\ = \
\int_A 1 \, \mbox{d}u
\ = \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \mathrm{I}[u \in A] \, \mathrm{d}u.$$]


## Ergodicity

A Markov chain is *ergodic* if it is aperiodic and irreducible.
Ergodicity is important because it ensures that we converge to the
stationary distribution if there is one.

**Fundamental theorem of Markov chain Monte Carlo**.  If the discrete
time, time-homogeneous Markov chain $Y = Y_1, Y_2, \ldots$ with $Y_t
\in \mathbb{R}^N$ is ergodic and has stationary distribution $\pi$,
then

$$
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}
\mbox{Pr}[Y_t \in A \mid Y_1 = y]
\ = \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \mathrm{I}[y \in A] \times \pi(y) \, \mathrm{d}y.
$$

Furthermore, for well-behaved functions $f$,^[The well-behavedness
required here is convergence of the absolute expectation,
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left| f(y) \right| \times \pi(y) \ \mathrm{d}y <
\infty.$$]

$$
\lim_{T \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \, f(Y_t)
\ = \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} f(u) \times \pi(u) \, \mathrm{d}u.
$$
