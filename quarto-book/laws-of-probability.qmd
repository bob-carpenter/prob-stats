# Basic Laws of Probability

Now that we have events, which are the bearers of probability in
probability theory, we are ready to introduce the basic algebraic laws
of probability.  We have presented probability theory as a *fait
accompli* up to this point, but will now step back and develop it more
from first principles.

## Axioms of probability

An event $A$ is just a set of possible outcomes, with $\textrm{Pr}[A]
\in [0, 1]$ being the probability of event $A$.  Probabilty theory is
based on three simple axioms.

### Axiom 1: Event probabilities are non-negative

Our first axiom says that event probabilities are non-negative.
$$
\textrm{Pr}[A] \geq 0 \textrm{ for all events } A.
$$
This is consistent with our informal definition of an event
probability as the average of indicator functions (i.e., the average
of a sequence of 0s and 1s).




### Axiom 2: The sample space has probability unity

The set of all possible outcomes is called the *sample space*.  For
example, if we are considering a single finite random variable taking
on values in 2--12, then the sample space is $S = \{ 2, 3, \ldots, 12
\}$.

The second axiom says that the event consisting of all possible
outcomes has probability unity.  That is, if $S$ is the sample space, then
$$
\textrm{Pr}[S] = 1.
$$
This assumes that the entire sample space is an event. With our
formulation of events as conditions on random variables, we just need
a condition $\phi$ that is always true.  For example, if $Y$ is a
discrete random variable, then the event $Y \in \mathbb{N}$ is based
on a condition that is always true, so that $\mathrm{I}[Y \in
\mathbb{N}]$ always evaluates to 1, so its average over draws of
$y^{(m)}$ is always 1, 
$$
\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \textrm{I}(y^{(m)} \in \mathbb{N})
= 1.
$$


### Axiom 3: Disjoint events have additive probability

A pair of sets $A$ and $B$ is *disjoint* if their intersection is
empty, i.e., $A \cap B = \emptyset$.  A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2,
\ldots$ is *pairwise disjoint* if $A_i$ and $A_j$ are disjoint for all
$i \neq j$.  The last axiom of proability theory says that the
probabilty of a union of pairwise disjoint events is the sum of their
individual probabilities.  In symbols, if $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is a
pairwise disjoint sequence of events, then the axiom of countable
additivity is
$$
\textrm{Pr}\left[ \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right]
    = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \textrm{Pr}[A_n].
$$
Of course, this implies finite additivity, which says that if events
$A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then
$$
\textrm{Pr}[A \cup B] = \textrm{Pr}[A] + \textrm{Pr}[B].
$$
